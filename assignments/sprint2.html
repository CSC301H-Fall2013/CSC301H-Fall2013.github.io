<p>This is a team assignment; each team submits one assignment</p>

<p><strong>Due Date for Preliminary Deliverables:</strong> November 5, 22:00:00 EST (No late submissions will be accepted).</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 3% of course grade</p>

<p><strong>Due Date for Final Deliverables:</strong> November 13, 22:00:00 EST (No late submissions will be accepted).</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 12% of course grade</p>
<p><strong>Submission format:</strong> commit all necessary files to your team GitHub repository by the deadline.</p>


<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goals of the project at this stage are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To practice working in an agile environment.</li>
	<li>To demonstrate a commitment to code quality.</li>
	<li>To add software tools to your development environment, if you haven't already.</li>
	<li>To complete the user stories assigned for the sprint.</li>
	<li>To reflect on the design process so far.</li>
	<li>To create and give a live demo of the software</li>
	<li>To plan for the final assignment of the term (which will include delivery to your customer and a screencast demoing your software)</li>
</ul>

<p>All work artifacts should be checked into the repository throughout the sprint. Time stamps and versions will be used especially to evaluate process tasks.</p>


<h3>Process Tasks</h3>

<p>The following tasks relate to the scrum process, not the performance of the product itself. Elements that can be documented should be included in your repository by the milestone due date, and all others will be verified by your TA at the weekly tutorial meetings.</p>

<h4>A working version of an Agile Development Process</h4>

<ul>
	<li></li>
	<li>Explain and be able to defend any design decisions you make.</li> 
	<li>Maintain a release backlog with with priority and time estimations.</li>
	<li>Hold a sprint planning meeting.</li>
	<li>Maintain sprint backlog where user stories are broken down into tasks</li>
	<li>Maintain a scrum board that shows the status of tasks (submit daily snapshots of it)</li>
	<li>Maintain a burn down chart with planned velocity and actual velocity</li>
	<li>Hold a sprint review. (Write 3 - 5 things that went well in this sprint, and 3 - 5 areas that need improvement. Discuss them with your team.)</li>
	<li>Recalculate your velocity, estimate and pick the next set of user stories that match the new velocity.</li>
	<li>Submit client meeting overview confirming client discussions about specs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: most of the items for this milestone should be things that you would generate anyway through the normal course of development. Just make sure that you document your progress thoroughly and consistently.</p>

<h4>Maintain Meeting Minutes and Attendance Spreadsheet</h4>

<p>Keep minutes for your all meetings (planning, scrums, and client). Minutes should include a list of who attended, what decisions were made (and how), and a list of action items (with deadlines and who they were assigned to.) Also, create a spreadsheet showing who attended which meetings. Make each meeting a column in the spreadsheet.</p>

<h4>Software Tools</h4>

<p>If you have not already done so, add the following tools to your process.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Version control</li>
	<li>Automated unit testing</li>
	<li>Automated integration testing OR Automated acceptance testing OR Automated UI testing (as appropriate for your software product)</li>
	<li>Work ticketing or User story tracking</li>
	<li>Scrum board or Kanban board</li>
</ul>	
<p>If you use third-party tools, be sure to provide your TA with access credentials for the purposes of grading.</p>

<h3>Product Tasks</h3>

<p>As with the Process Tasks, the Product Tasks are ongoing. They may be checked by the TA at the end or during the sprint.</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>For every story, there must be either an automated tests or a test plan for manual testing. These should be produced before the application code is written.</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Create the functionality for multiple user stories. Every team member must write code.</p>

<h4>Code Quality</h4>
<p>Produce code that is easy to read and easy to understand. Use comments, developer notes, diagrams, and documentation as appropriate to facilitate comprehension.</p> 

<h4>Storyboard for User Interaction</h4>
<p>Describe what the user can do in your program and how. Provide screenshots and navigation descriptions for the current interface to the program.</p>
<p>Some questions to think about may include (but not limited to): - What will your application be able to do? - What kind of information will it display? - What will the user see at each stage of usage? - What will the screen layout be like?</p>
<p>This document will be used to prepare the User Manual that is expected as part of the final release.</p>

<h4>Demo</h4>

<p>Give a demo to show your software to best effect. The demo should last five minutes, followed by a five-minute question-and-answer period.</p>

<h4>Updates to Design and Technology Manifesto</h4>

<p>Describe any design changes that were made to the structure or data flow of the product.</p>

<h3>Specification for Next Sprint</h3>

<p>Write a specification for what you will build for the next sprint. Think about what / how many features (user stories) you should build, what other supporting documentation should be submitted with them, and what criteria should be used to judge success (i.e. how will your TAs mark Sprint 2?)</p>


<h3>What and How to Submit</h3>

<p><strong>Preliminary Deliverables:</strong> Sprint backlog, burn down chart, scrum board, automated test cases, and test plans are due on November 5. The TAs will give you feedback on them during tutorial.</p>

<p><strong>Final versions</strong> of all deliverables are due on November 13.</p>

<p><strong>In both cases, submission will be through GitHub.</strong></p>

<p>Create a web page for Sprint 2. From there add links to all elements that you want graded. Many of the links will be to your group's github repository. This includes meeting minutes, notes about your conversations with the customers, test plan, test code, user stories, source code, and any other explicit and implicit deliverables.</p>

<p>The above requirements are subject to changes based on feedback from the course bulletin board. This page will be frozen at midnight on Friday, November 8.</p>
