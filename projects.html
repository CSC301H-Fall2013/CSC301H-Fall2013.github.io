<p><a href="http://CitizenBridge.org">CitizenBridge.org</a> is a not-for-profit civic engagement organization that created a Democracy 2.0 platform that allows Canadians and their Elected Representatives to have a conversation about the issues at the Federal, Provincial, and Municipal levels of government.  It was built by eight passionate people (in their spare time, and with no budget) with the goal of modernizing how Canadians engage with their Government. CitizenBridge.org gives Canadians the opportunity to be active participants with their government instead of being passive observers of their government.</p>

<p>This project is to build version 2.0 of the CitizenBridge public-facing web site. The back end needs to be re-architected to take advantage of the latest ParliamentData.ca API. The front end needs to be more informative, responsive, and accessible, using standard CSS toolkits, such as <a href="https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew">Web Experience Toolkit</a> or <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>An electoral system is a method for allocating and counting votes in elections. In Canada, we use First Past the Post (FPTP) where the candidate with the largest number of votes in a district wins. Alternative electoral systems are Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) or Single Transferable Vote (STV).  But these have not been widely used in Canada, so it’s difficult for candidates to plan for and allocate resources.</p>

<p>For the “Election Tycoon” project, we will be taking large datasets from Statistics Canada, Elections Canada, and other electoral and geographic data to build a planning tool. With this tool, users will be able to understand the effectiveness of a campaign under the various electoral systems. By effectiveness, we mean the likelihood of winning an election with a given resource allocation.</p>

<p><em>Problem:</em> Globally, approximately 80% of maternal deaths are due to pregnancy-related complications with over 529,000 women dying each year.  99% of these deaths occur in developing countries.  Initially we will focus on Nepal that has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world at 740 per 100,000 births or almost 4,500 maternal deaths annually.</p>

<p><em>Solution:</em> By building an ultrasound train-the-trainer program whereby Nepalese health care workers at an NGO will be trained on how to use ultrasound and these trained staff will then train other staff. The local Nepalese staff will triage maternal conditions on medical treks to remote resource-poor areas of Nepal using portable ultrasound (which exists) and bidirectional communication between the remote areas and the hospital/medical centre.</p>

<p><em>Our Challenge:</em> Allowing ultrasound images to be transmitted to medical centres and managing image data so that attending radiologists can diagnose/predict maternal complications.  This will improve the care of mothers and potentially save lives as it allows determining whether the mother can, for example, deliver safely in the remote area or must be transported to hospital.</p>

<p><em>What we need:</em> Software (server) to receive images from mobile apps and manage various users and workflows in a secure environment.  Users are (1) remote health care workers who generate the images and require (and receive) diagnostic feedback for their patients, and (2) radiologists who assess the ultrasound images remotely (potentially worldwide) on a volunteer basis.  Depending on the diagnosis there are various workflows. These can involve simple feedback (patient is okay) or more complex instructions and information (e.g. annotated images to demonstrate health risk to patient).</p>

<p><a href="http://acorncanada.org">ACORN Canada</a> is a membership based community organization that focuses on social justice and leadership development in low and moderate income communities across Canada.  Our main project areas include: Healthy Homes, Remittance Justice, Digital Access To Opportunities, Raising the Minimum Wage and more.</p>

<p>This project looks to develop an interactive mapping platform that would display sub-standard housing 
complaints captured by a number of outreach techniques (door to door, flyers, on line eblasts, and more) 
that would be sent into the interactive map through text messaging and though a web browser.  The information would include minimum criteria to be determined, such as: mold and pest infestation, unit disrepair, heat problems, and security issues. The data will be displayed on a Google Map. The purpose of the interactive map would be to expose the huge amount of housing problems that exist in large Canadian Cities. Toronto will serve as a pilot site with the aim of broadening the project to Ottawa and eventually nation-wide.</p>
