<p>The primary aim of the course is to teach agile software development methods. These techniques will be practiced on a course project that lasts for the duration of the term. Each assignment will be an iteration or "sprint." The project will be carried out in groups of six, to be assigned by the instructor.</p>

<p>Deadlines for deliverables and milestones are scheduled as follows.</p>

<p>No late assignments will be accepted.</p>

<a name="final-demos" class="anchor" href="#final-demos"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Demos</h3>
<p>Final project demos will be held on Saturday, November 30 during a full-day event. Project clients and the general public will be invited to attend.</p>


<h3>
<a name="quizzes" class="anchor" href="#quizzes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quizzes</h3>

<p>Quizzes will be held every week on Thursday except for the first and last weeks of the term. They are closed book.</p>

<h3>
<a name="peer-evaluation" class="anchor" href="#peer-evaluation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Peer Evaluation</h3>

<p>One of the goals of this course is to teach students to work effectively as team members. Individual participation and contribution to the term project will be assessed through peer evaluation. Consequently, every student will be required to submit evaluations of all their team members at the conclusion of each sprint. Students will be graded on the quality of the peer evaluation that they produce and their own growth as a team member.</p>

<p>Peer evaluations are due on October 4, October 25, November 15, and December 3.</p>


<h3>
<a name="final-exam" class="anchor" href="#final-exam"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Exam</h3>

<p>The final exam is worth 25% of the overall mark for the course. It is composed of 3 sections (short-answer, medium-answer and long-answer), and is 3 hours in length.</p>

<p>You are allowed one 8.5"x11" hand-written two-sided reference sheet in the exam. No other aids are permitted.</p>

<p>Students must earn at least 40% on the final exam in order to pass the course.</p>

<h3>
<a name="academic-integrity" class="anchor" href="#academic-integrity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>All assignments in this course will be done in teams, with grades awarded to the team as a whole. Team members are strongly encouraged to discuss design ideas, coding issues, etc., with one another. You are also encouraged to use the tutorial hour on Thursday to hold team meetings, design sessions, etc.</p>

<p>However, collaboration between teams should be treated the same way as collaboration between individuals in past courses. You and your teammates may discuss and compare general approaches with members of other teams, and talk about how to get around specific difficulties (e.g., how to use a Java performance profiling tool on CDF with Eclipse), but you should never look at another team's solution to an assignment, even in draft form.</p>

<p>Plagiarism (the act of representing someone else's work or ideas as your own---is a form of academic dishonesty, and is treated very seriously, regardless of whether you are the donor or the recipient. Please refer to the material provided by 
<a href="http://http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/osai/students/academic-integrity-basics">Office of Student Academic Integrity</a> for details.</p>
